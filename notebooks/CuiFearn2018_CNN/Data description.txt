Wheat Kernels
 
Sample description

Wheat kernels (415) representing 43 different varieties or variety mixtures from two different 
locations in Denmark made up the calibration set, while wheat kernels (108) representing 11 
different varieties from one location made up the test set10. All kernels were randomly chosen 
from bulk samples. The test samples were acquired with the calibration samples, but stored for 
about 2 additional months before measurement in order to provide a check for temporal drift in 
the samples and instrumentation.
