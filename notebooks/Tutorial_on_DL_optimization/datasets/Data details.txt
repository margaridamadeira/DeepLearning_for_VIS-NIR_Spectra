DATA USED IN THE REGRESSION TUTORIAL:

The data set used in this study has a total of 11,691 NIR spectra (684–990 ​nm in 3 ​nm sampling with a total 103 variables) 
and Dry Matter (DM %) measurements performed on 4675 mango fruit across 4 harvest seasons 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
The provided data set has been cleaned by removing a few outliers from the original data by using Hotelling’s T2 and Q 
statistics from a PLS decomposition. The version of the data used in this tutorial is a concatenation of the original 
spectra with its SNV, 1st deriv, 2nd deriv, SNV+1st deriv and SNV+2nd deriv.

DATA USED IN THE CLASSIFICATION TUTORIAL:

The wheat dataset shared here is a copy of the original dataset available at https://github.com/L-Zhou17/Wheat-kernels
It contains a NIR spectral dataset of wheat kernels of 30 varieties. 
Columns 1 to 200 correspond to the spectral variables and the last column contains the varieties labels.
According to the instructions of the authors (Zhou et al 2020), 
i) DT_train-1.csv,DT_train-2.csv,DT_train-3.csv,DT_train-4.csv,DT_train-5.csv, are concatenated (vertically) and redifined as training data
ii) The same is used to create the validation set from 'DT_val#.csv', files and
iii) the test set from 'DT_test#.csv' files.

File names: DT_###.csv
File types: Comma Separated Values (.csv)
